Design and analysis of algorithm

Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) explores algorithmic principles, efficiency analysis, and problem-solving techniques. It covers algorithm design paradigms, data structures, and optimization strategies, enabling efficient solutions to complex computational problems in various applications and domains. In this I have uploaded all the codes we used in daa.

Git and Github

GIT: Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development, facilitating collaboration and history.
GITHUB: GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. It hosts code repositories and fosters community development.

Agile pratices

Agile practices emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback to deliver valuable software quickly. Teams prioritize adaptability, communication, and delivering small, functional increments. Key methodologies include Scrum and Kanban, fostering flexibility and continuous improvement in project management. In this, I have uploaded the files for unit1.
